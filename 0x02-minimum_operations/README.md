# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Introduction

The "Minimum Operations" problem involves determining the smallest number of operations needed to achieve a given goal, typically by transforming an integer `n` into a desired value. Solving this problem efficiently requires a solid understanding of various computer science and mathematical concepts, including dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, and greedy algorithms.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It involves solving each subproblem just once and storing the solution to avoid redundant work.

- **Why It's Important**: Dynamic programming helps in optimizing the solution to the "Minimum Operations" problem by reducing the problem into manageable parts and building up the solution step by step.

### 2. Prime Factorization

Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime factors. This is crucial for the "Minimum Operations" problem because the problem can often be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

- **Why It's Important**: Understanding prime factorization allows you to decompose the problem mathematically, enabling a more efficient approach to finding the solution.

### 3. Code Optimization

Code optimization is about making your code run faster and use fewer resources. This is essential when dealing with large input sizes or when performance is a critical factor.

- **Why It's Important**: Optimizing your code ensures that the solution to the "Minimum Operations" problem is not only correct but also efficient, capable of handling edge cases and large inputs.

### 4. Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms involve making the best possible choice at each step to arrive at a global optimum. This approach can sometimes be used to solve the "Minimum Operations" problem by iteratively reducing the problem size.

- **Why It's Important**: Greedy algorithms provide a straightforward method for solving the problem by continuously selecting the most advantageous option.
