# 0x05. N Queens Project

## Introduction

The "0x05. N Queens" project is a well-known challenge in computer science and mathematics. It involves placing `N` queens on an `NÃ—N` chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other. This problem is a classic example of the backtracking algorithm, a powerful technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems. Successfully completing this project will enhance your understanding of key algorithmic concepts and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Key Concepts and Resources

To tackle the N Queens problem, you will need to understand several key concepts and techniques:

### 1. Backtracking Algorithms
**Backtracking** is a methodical way of trying out various sequences of decisions until you find one that "works." When applied to the N Queens problem, backtracking explores all potential ways to place queens on the board, backtracking whenever a conflict (i.e., an attack between queens) is detected.

### 2. Recursion
**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. In the context of the N Queens problem, recursion is used to attempt placing queens row by row, exploring all possibilities until a valid arrangement is found.

### 3. List Manipulations in Python
Lists in Python are essential for storing and manipulating the positions of queens on the chessboard. Understanding how to work with lists will help you track queen positions and determine if a new position is valid.

### 4. Python Command Line Arguments
Handling command-line arguments is crucial for building flexible scripts that can accept input directly from the user. In the N Queens project, the board size `N` is typically passed as a command-line argument.

## Implementation Overview

To implement the N Queens solution, you will follow these general steps:

1. **Input Handling:** Accept the board size `N` as a command-line argument and validate it.
2. **Backtracking Algorithm:** Use a recursive function to attempt placing queens on the board, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other.
3. **Validation:** For each queen placement, check that it does not conflict with previously placed queens.
4. **Output:** If a valid arrangement is found, output the positions of the queens.
