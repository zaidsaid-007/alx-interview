# Prime Number Game Challenge - README

## Overview

In this project, you will apply concepts from prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario involving the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The task is to determine the winner of the game based on optimal strategies for removing prime numbers.

## Concepts Required

### Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. Understanding prime numbers is fundamental, as the game revolves around their identification and removal from the game’s set of numbers.

#### Key Points

- A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Efficiently identifying prime numbers in a range is crucial to this challenge.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes

The **Sieve of Eratosthenes** is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. This method will be used in the game to generate a list of prime numbers quickly, especially for large sets of numbers.

#### Steps

1. Create an array of consecutive integers from 2 to n.
2. Start with the first number (2). Mark all its multiples as non-prime.
3. Move to the next unmarked number and repeat the process.
4. Continue until you've processed all numbers in the array.

### Game Theory

In this game, two players take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a list of integers. The key to winning lies in optimal play, where each player aims to minimize the other player’s chances of winning.

#### Key Points

- Players alternate turns in a competitive setting.
- Optimal strategies often involve forcing the opponent into a losing position by controlling available moves.

### Dynamic Programming / Memoization

To optimize the solution, dynamic programming or memoization techniques may be needed. These techniques involve storing the results of previously solved subproblems to avoid redundant computations, especially in recursive solutions.

#### Benefits

- Reduces time complexity.
- Efficiently solves problems with overlapping subproblems.

### Python Programming

Python will be the language used to implement the solution. You will need to work with:

- **Lists** to manage the game state.
- **Loops and conditional logic** to simulate the game process.
- **Recursive functions** or **dynamic programming** to optimize strategy calculations.

## How the Game Works

1. A set of consecutive integers is presented to the players (e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).
2. Two players alternate turns.
3. On each turn, the player must:
   - Remove a prime number from the set.
   - Remove all multiples of that prime number from the set.
4. The game ends when no more prime numbers can be removed.
5. The player unable to make a move loses the game.

## Key Algorithms

### Prime Number Identification (Sieve of Eratosthenes)

This algorithm is key to identifying all prime numbers within the range efficiently. For large sets, a brute-force approach is impractical, and using the Sieve ensures optimal performance.

### Optimal Game Strategy

Using **game theory** principles, you will design an optimal strategy that involves:

- Identifying which prime numbers give a player an advantage.
- Forcing the opponent into positions where they have fewer valid moves.
- Implementing **dynamic programming** to track and optimize move sequences, ensuring that the best move is made each turn.
